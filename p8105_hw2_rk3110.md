# Section 0

Loading the libraries needed for this homework.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

# Problem 1

First we need to import data from the Mr. Trash Wheel excel file.
Looking at it, there is banner on line one that has a drawing of
Mr. Wheel. While cute, we should exclude that line from the import. We
will also clean the names up while we are at it.

``` r
trash_df = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...15
    ## * `` -> ...16
    ## * `` -> ...17

# Problem 2

Now we take a look at the FiveThirtyEight data. Let’s import the first
csv, clean names, and separate the date variable into its components.

``` r
pols_df = 
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "/")
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9

    ## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): mon
    ## dbl (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, re...

    ## 
    ## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
