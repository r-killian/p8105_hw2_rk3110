# Section 0

Loading the libraries needed for this homework.

# Problem 1

First we need to import data from the Mr. Trash Wheel excel file. Looking at it, there is banner on line one that has a drawing of Mr. Wheel. While cute, we should exclude that line from the import. We will also clean the names up while we are at it. 

```{r}
trash_df = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```


# Problem 2

Now we take a look at the FiveThirtyEight data. Let's import the first csv, clean names, and separate the date variable into its components.

```{r}
pols_df = 
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "/")
```
